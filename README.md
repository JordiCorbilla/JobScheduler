# Job Scheduler
Simple Job Scheduler for .NET.

The idea behind this simple Job Scheduler is to provide a way of running specific jobs at certain times during the day. The Scheduler runs every 10s and loads the list of jobs to run at a specific time of the day. Once the time is met, the job is executed using a task.
As the loading of the tasks happens every 10s, changes are easily detected and the Scheduler will allocate/deallocate tasks at will.

Example usage is as follows:

```C#
class Program
    {
        private static JobManager JobManager { get; set; }
        private static readonly object Mylock = new object();

        static void Main()
        {
            JobManager = new JobManager(Dump);

            Timer timer = new Timer
            {
                Interval = 10000, //Every 10 seconds
                Enabled = true
            };

            timer.Elapsed += OnTimedEvent;
            Dump("Starting Job Scheduler by [Jordi Corbilla]");
            Console.Read();
        }

        private static void OnTimedEvent(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e)
        {
            //Load all the jobs
            if (Monitor.TryEnter(Mylock))
            {
                try
                {
                    JobManager.Run();
                    LoadJobs();
                }
                finally
                {
                    Monitor.Exit(Mylock);
                }
            }
            Dump($"[{DateTime.UtcNow:hh:mm:ss tt} UTC] Running.");
        }

        private static void LoadJobs()
        {
            IDal sqlDal = new SqlDal();
            Collection<TimeSchedule> timeScheduleList = sqlDal.GetListTimeSchedules();

            JobManager.UnMark();
            foreach (var time in timeScheduleList)
            {
                DateTime today = DateTime.UtcNow;
                //Compose the new date
                DateTime newTime = new DateTime(today.Year, today.Month, today.Day, time.Time.Hour, time.Time.Minute, time.Time.Second);
                if (newTime > today) //then we can add it to the list
                {
                    JobTest job = new JobTest(time.Id, newTime) {Marked = true};
                    JobManager.Load(job);
                }
            }
            JobManager.DeleteUnMarked();
        }

        private static void Dump(string message)
        {
            //Add anything here
            Console.WriteLine(message);
        }
    }
```

Your new Job needs to descend from Job class and in there specify the task to be run:
```C#
    public class JobTest : Job
    {
        public JobTest(int id, DateTime time) : base(Dump)
        {
            Id = id;
            Time = time;
        }

        private static void Dump(string message)
        {
            //Add anything here
            Console.WriteLine(message);
        }

        public override void Run()
        {
            Task.Factory.StartNew(() => { Console.WriteLine($"[{DateTime.Now:hh:mm:ss tt} UTC] It runs JobTest!"); });
            Active = false;
        }
    }
```
Sample log of the Scheduler running is as follows:
```Bash
[10:46:07 PM UTC] Running.
[10:46:17 PM UTC] Running.
[10:46:27 PM UTC] Running.
New Job added with Id [3] scheduled at: [10:55:00 PM UTC]
[10:46:37 PM UTC] Running.
Job has been updated with Id [3], Old Time: [10:55:00 PM UTC], New Time: [10:50:00 PM UTC]
[10:46:47 PM UTC] Running.
[10:46:57 PM UTC] Running.
[10:47:07 PM UTC] Running.
..
..
[10:50:07 PM UTC] It runs JobTest!.
```
